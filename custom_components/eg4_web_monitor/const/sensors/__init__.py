"""Sensor type definitions for the EG4 Web Monitor integration.

This subpackage contains all sensor-related constants:
- types: SensorConfig TypedDict
- inverter: Main SENSOR_TYPES dictionary
- mappings: Field mappings and sensor lists
- gridboss: GridBOSS sensor definitions
- station: Station/plant sensor definitions

During refactoring, sensor constants are re-exported from the parent
const package for backward compatibility.

from __future__ import annotations

# Placeholder - will be populated as sensor modules are extracted
# For now, sensor constants are imported via const/__init__.py from _const_legacy.py
